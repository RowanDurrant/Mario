# Mario
R was not designed to make platformers

Horrible cursed code that barely works. Since R wasn't made for this you have to enter the controls in readline which makes gameplay super slow, 
and I haven't found a good way to add any enemies or whatever yet, but this is technically a platformer in the barest sense of the word. 
The .csv file included loads in a poor approximation of level one of Mario, but you can make custom levels by just adding obstacles/ ground wherever

To do list: 
- make it so he can't just zone through the platform when jumping 
- add coins
- add the mystery box things???
